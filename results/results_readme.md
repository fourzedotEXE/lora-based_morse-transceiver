## There is one video demo and some images showing the device internals as part of the results directory
- morse_lora_1.mp4 shows me sending a message to the main device using the transceiver
- Attempting to receive a message from the main device to the transceiver was unsuccesful during testing so no further demonstration was provided

## You may also use the youtube link I provided in the parent directory README under the "Results" section or these ones
